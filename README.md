A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## How to Run the project

Navigate to your Playwright project directory in your terminal.

You must have Node.js, NPM, and Mabl CLI installed.

```bash
  mabl tests import playwright --path {path-to-your-test-file} --project {project-name}
```

Note: Including the --project flag (e.g., chromium) helps mabl correctly identify the baseURL and application settings.
